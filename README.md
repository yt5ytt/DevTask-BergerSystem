# DevTask-BergerSystem
Berger system is a system of determining pairs of sports competitions in circular tournaments, in which players play on a one-on-one basis. It found the greatest application in chess.

It is named after the Austrian chess master Johann Berger. As the best developed of all known circular systems, Berger system has found application in addition to chess in all other team and individual sports, wherever participants play according to the system one by one. Since the participants of the competition play according to the system of each other, tournaments organized according to this system give the fairest placement of the participants. All attempts to find a fairer system have so far been unsuccessful.
